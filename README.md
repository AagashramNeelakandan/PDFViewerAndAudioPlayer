# PDFViewerandAudioPlayer
PDF Viewer & Audio Player is a site where one can view PDF and play .mp3 audio simultaneously. The intended use of this site is for practising listening tests of various languages, where one has to follow a pdf and audio together. Also, as all these things happen in a single browser tab, only that tab needs to be shared in an online meeting and not the entire screen, thus saving the bandwidth. Please note that all files are processed and stored locally.
